# Filas  - Lista 03

(1) Implement in C functions for manipulating integer queues.

API:
   + void put (Queue, int)
   + int get (Queue)
   + int isEmpty (Queue)


1.1 Implement circular queues with arrays (1.1)

1.2 Implement queues with your implementation for integer linked lists (1.2).


(2) Use the functions implemented in question 1.2 to implement exercise number 3.10 of Ziviani's book.

(3) How can we say that a circular queue is empty / is full?

(4) What are the benefits/drawbacks of providing another pointer variable "tail" to keep track of the end of the queue?
