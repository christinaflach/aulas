# Pilhas  - Lista 02

(1) Implement in C functions for manipulating integers stacks. Use your implementation for integer linked lists.

API:
   + void push (Stack, int)
   + int pop (Stack)
   + int top (Stack)
   + int isEmpty (Stack)


(2) Use the functions implemented in question 1 to implement a C program that reads an expression involving additions and multiplications of integer numbers, in postfix notation, evaluates it and prints the result.

```
Input: 5 9 8 + 4 6 * * 7 + *
```

```
Output: 2075
